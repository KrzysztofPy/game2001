# game2001
FLASK project

This is the game of user vs computer. Each player is throwing a dice twice at each round. The sum of points is added to their score with two exceptions:
- if the player's score is equal to 7, then his/her points are divided by 7  
- if the player's score is equal to 11, then his/her score is multiplied by 11
Whoever reaches score of 2001 first, or whoever has higher number of points if both reach that goal at the same round, wins.
